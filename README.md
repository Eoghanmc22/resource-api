# Resource API
Resource API's goal is to make adding assets to the game as easy as it is to do anything else with minestom

## Todo
Expand upon data/json api (templates, using a namespaced id as model, nested) \
Multi Part Entities (maybe separate) \
Fonts (centering, custom glyphs, width calculation, vertical height fonts, maybe separate) \
Sounds \
Particles \
Shaders \
Unit tests? \
